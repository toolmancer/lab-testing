    <h2>1. Data Collection and Processing</h2>
    <p>ToolMancer is designed as a privacy-first application. All data processing (such as image compression, PDF creation, and text encryption) occurs directly on your device using your browser's capabilities. We do not transmit, store, or process any of your personal files or input data on our servers.</p>

    <!-- START OF NEW SECTION -->
    <h2>1a. Exception for AI Tools</h2>
    <p>While the vast majority of our tools operate strictly on your device for maximum privacy, a few specialized tools in the "AI Tools" category are designed to interact with external third-party AI service providers (like Hugging Face) to deliver their functionality. When using these specific AI tools (e.g., Image to Prompt), your data (e.g., the image file) will be transmitted to and processed by these external services.</p>
    <p>ToolMancer does not store this data itself. However, by using these specific tools, you acknowledge that your data will be transmitted externally. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any third-party providers when using these features.</p>

    <h2>2. Cookies and Local Storage</h2>
    <p>We use local storage (a feature of your web browser) to save basic preferences to enhance your experience. This includes saving your selected theme mode (light or dark) and other non-identifying settings. These settings are stored locally on your device only.</p>

### Summary of Changes:

In changes 1 and 2, humne user ko saaf-saaf bata diya hai ki AI tool ek external API ka use karta hai. Baki sabhi non-AI tools (Image to PDF, Compressor, Word Counter, etc.) ke liye "privacy first, local processing" ka daava ab bhi sahi hai.
